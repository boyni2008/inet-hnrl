The 'isp_traffic_shaping_cooperative' is a set of simulation models and
scenarios for the investigation of cooperative ISP traffic shaping schemes --
proposed by Luke E. Farmer and updated by Kyeong Soo Kim -- in next-generation
access networks based on OMNeT++ and INET, which implements a shared token-bucket
filter (TBF) queue module.
